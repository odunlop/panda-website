        <h2>Panda Behavior</h2>
        <p>Pandas are fascinating animals that display a variety of interesting behaviours. Here are some things you might not know about these amazing creatures:</p>
        
        <h3>Mating</h3>
        <p>Pandas are solitary animals, so they only come together during the breeding season. Females are only fertile for a few days each year, and males will often fight over the chance to mate with them. Once a male is selected, he and the female will engage in a series of behaviours that include vocalizations, scent marking, and physical contact.</p>
        <p>The gestational period for a panda is between 95 and 160 days. Females will usually give birth to one or two cubs, although in rare cases they can have three. The cubs are born blind and helpless, and they will stay with their mother for up to three years before becoming independent.</p>
        
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Pandas are herbivores and mainly eat bamboo. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to digest tough bamboo stalks. Pandas can eat up to 40 pounds of bamboo a day! In addition to bamboo, they may also eat fruits, vegetables, and occasionally small animals.</p>
      
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Pandas communicate with each other using a variety of methods. They have a number of vocalizations, including bleats, honks, and roars. They may also use body language, such as rolling on their backs or rubbing their scent glands on trees, to communicate with other pandas. Pandas also have a keen sense of smell and will use scent marking to indicate their territory or attract a mate.</p>

      <h2>Panda Conservation</h2>
      <p>Due to habitat loss and hunting, pandas have become an endangered species. However, conservation efforts have helped to increase their numbers in recent years. Organizations like the World Wildlife Fund and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda are dedicated to protecting and preserving panda habitats.</p>
